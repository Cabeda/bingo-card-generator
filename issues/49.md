## Updated Issue Description

### Current Challenges with Mobile Responsiveness
- Cards may still encounter layout issues on smaller screens, especially in edge cases.
- Some new UI components introduced in the recent updates are not fully optimized for mobile devices.
- Touch interactions, while improved, might not yet meet the updated accessibility standards.
- Horizontal scrolling persists in certain scenarios, particularly with the new PDF generation features.
- The navigation menu may need further refinement to align with recent code updates.

### Proposed Enhancements

#### 1. Refine Mobile-First Design
Update the card layout and scaling algorithms based on the latest grid and flexbox utilities introduced in the codebase. Ensure compatibility with new screen sizes and orientations.

#### 2. Optimize New UI Components
Adapt the recently added components, such as the PDF generation UI and the navigation bar, to ensure they render and function seamlessly on devices with smaller viewports.

#### 3. Enhance Touch Accessibility
Ensure that all new buttons and interactive elements introduced in the updates meet the minimum touch target size (44x44px for iOS and 48x48px for Android) and are spaced appropriately to avoid accidental taps.

#### 4. Test and Adjust Breakpoints
Evaluate the current CSS breakpoints in light of the new updates and adjust them to improve responsiveness across a wider range of devices.

#### 5. Improve Navigation Experience
Refactor the mobile navigation to accommodate the latest design patterns and ensure a consistent user experience across all screen sizes.
