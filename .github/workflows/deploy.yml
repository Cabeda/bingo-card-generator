    # Note: Vercel automatically deploys from the main branch
    # This workflow serves as a CI check before Vercel deployment
    # If you want to deploy to Vercel from GitHub Actions instead:
    # 1. Install Vercel CLI: npm i -g vercel
    # 2. Add VERCEL_TOKEN, VERCEL_ORG_ID, and VERCEL_PROJECT_ID to secrets
    # 3. Uncomment and configure the following step:
    #
    # - name: Deploy to Vercel
    #   run: |
    #     vercel --prod --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
    #   env:
    #     VERCEL_ORG_ID: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_ORG_ID }}
    #     VERCEL_PROJECT_ID: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_PROJECT_ID }}
